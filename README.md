# Configuration Files

My custom config files and rcs.

Now includes duckdns scripts, scripts for yt-dlp, and some env variables. (Requires a user defined .env file)

## Installation

Inside the repository you can run `install` to place the configs in `~`.
This will symlink them from the repository, so you can easily update with `git
pull`.
